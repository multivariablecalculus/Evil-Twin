# Evil-Twin
Yes, Evil Twin attacks are not all that common and require a bit of expertise in the field of IoT, but anyone can do just fine with them. Since I am a low-life creature, I learnt Evil-Twin from YT and a bit of networking theory from a book. Now, Evil-Twin is a type of 2-step deauth attack which disconnects a client from a server and creates another "fake" server or "evil-twin" server which acts as the control panel of the attacker, and the bait for the victim. Just when the victim tries to connect to the fake server, he will enter the credentials, which will be redirected to the attacker, and the victim will be unauthenticated, i.e. they will be logged off, and won't be able to connect to any network for a while. Concluding; the attacker has the SSID, passkey and IPv4, IPv6, DNS and might have MAC and the victim is done for, even though they will be able to connect to the network after a while.
